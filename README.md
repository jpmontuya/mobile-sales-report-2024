### Analysis Breakdown ###

Total phone revenue for 2024 landed at **₱247 million**, driven by** 5,684 units**, all accumulated over the year at an average **.10%** month-over-month growth. At roughly ₱43k per device. Notably, the **Bangsamoro region (BARMM)** posted the highest unit count, the approaches implemented at the certain region works. This success suggests we could get similar results in other regions by using the same methods.

Data reveals the clear crowd-pleaser is the **iPhone 15**, moving **735 units** more than any other single model in the lineup, that means one out of every eight phones sold last year was this latest iPhone, confirming that customers still flock to Apple’s newest release. Stocking this model heavily and using it as the hero product in promos should keep momentum strong.

Here shows that both storage sizes are popular. The **256 GB** phones sold about **2,881 units**, while the 128 GB phones sold around 2,803 units, a very small difference of roughly 80 units.

**Luzon** drives almost half of all phone sales at about **2,500 units**, Mindanao brings in a healthy 1,700 or so, and Visayas lags slightly at roughly 1,400, this pattern shows Luzon must stay front-and-center with ample stock and regular promos, Mindanao has big growth potential if we open more stores in key areas and offer local deals. For Visayas, a quick review of pricing or distribution is needed to capture the demand that’s still there.

Phone color preferences are **fairly even**. Black leads slightly at 22%, followed by green at 21%, with red close behind at 18%. No color stands out as a clear favorite, so a balanced inventory is important. Stocking a bit more black and green makes sense, while promos or bundles can help boost sales of the less popular colors.

Credit cards lead with 132 transactions, followed by e-cash at 124 and cash at 110. Each method is used by about a third of customers, showing that **offering** all **three payment options** smoothly is **essential**.

Monthly demand stays **steady** at around **450–500 units**. February drops to about 400 units and has the lowest customer rating, while October peaks at 510 despite only average ratings. Sales bounce back in March with the highest satisfaction score and rise again before the October surge, likely due to promos or new models. November dips in both sales and ratings, but December ends strong. Trends show sales follow customer sentiment, so improving the February experience and repeating what works in October could help maintain higher sales year-round.

### Conclusion ###

To drive growth, keep Luzon well-stocked with strong promos and apply BARMM’s local strategies in other areas. Boost February with early-year bundles and repeat October’s successful campaigns. Focus on 256 GB iPhone 15 bundles, but keep Google and Xiaomi visible to attract new buyers. Offer all colors, with extra stock of black and green. Continue supporting all payment methods and add small perks to encourage e-cash and card use for a smoother checkout experience.
